# Zwift Workout File Reference

A project to create reference documentation for the XML elements and attributes
used in Zwift custom workout files.

The **[Zwift Workout File Reference is here](./zwift_workout_file_tag_reference.md)**

## Contributing

Many of the elements/attributes are not yet described. Help to improve the
descriptions would be great.

The reference is generated from two sources:

* Manually created descriptions and examples in 
  [descriptions.yaml](descriptions.yaml)
* Automatically generated data in [tag_attr_usage.json](tag_attr_usage.json)
    * This data is generated by 
      [zwift_zwo_docs/analyze_zwo.py](zwift_zwo_docs/analyze_zwo.py) which
      analyses Zwift workout files to find the elements/attributes they use.
    * The `tag_attr_usage.json` committed here is the result of analysing all of
      the workouts that come with Zwift. The workout files themselves can't be
      committed here as they're copyrighted.

### How to contribute

You can add descriptions and examples to `descriptions.yaml`.

To re-generate `zwift_workout_file_tag_reference.md`, install Python 3.7, then:

```console
$ cd <to/this/repo>
$ pip install .
$ make
```

Commit changes to both, then submit a PR to this repo.
